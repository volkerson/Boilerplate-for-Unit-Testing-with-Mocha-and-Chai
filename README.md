<h1>BOILERPLATE FOR UNIT TESTING WITH MOCHA AND CHAI</h1>

<p>
Testing is a very important part of the work of a developer.  Writing tests helps you to write better code because you have to think about all the unexpected cases and you will handle them.<br><br>
I created a little test evironment, based on the Mocha Framework and the Chai Library and added a simple test for an add-function. <br>Feel free to download and use it.
